## Mechanics

### Wall Jumping

Press the **Jump** button while touching a wall and not the floor to jump
off of the wall. This jump is useful for reversing Sonic's direction if
he's about to run into a wall.

### Bunnyhopping

Pressing the **Jump** button to jump off the floor while Sonic is moving
will multiply Sonic's speed by 1.3. Chain together these jumps to
bunnyhop and break the speed limits! At least until you run into a wall
or a ditch.
