Sonic the Hedgehog was on his way to one of Eggman's more fortified desert bases
after the moustached dictator had launched missiles towards a nearby village,
for the sake of getting another foot in his "construction business". A usual
day, all things considered.

That is, until something bright caught his eye, off in the distance. After
following the source of the mysterious flash of light, Sonic had come across a
strange device, calling itself the "Re;Velocity System".

Upon picking this device up, its power surged into Sonic, causing the young
hedgehog to collapse from immediate exhaustion -- the device's energy potential
proving too great even for someone as strong as him.

After recovering from the shock of having absorbed the device's power and
subsequently collapsing, Sonic felt the strange energy coursing through him,
encouraging him to run - run with a **re**newed **velocity** neither he nor
anyone had experienced before.
