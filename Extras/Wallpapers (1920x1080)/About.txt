Sonic Re;Velocity wallpapers!
Just like with Green Hill Zone Simulator, Sonic Re;Velocity comes with a set of wallpapers that are taken from various aspects of the game.
Unfortunately, though, I forgot to save the original XCF files. Sorry.

Here's a quick explanation of all of the wallpapers:

- GHZSim-vs-SRV.png: This pictures the Sonic from Green Hill Zone Simulator sliding towards the Sonic from Sonic Re;Velocity, who are probably about to start running into each other really fast (or in GHZSim Sonic's case, rolling around at the speed of woohoo)
- Sonic-ReVelocity.png: This is simply the Sonic Re;Velocity title screen with the game's logo positioned off to the left so you can see more of Sonic. The -Centred variant positions the logo back in the centre of the wallpaper.
- Velocity-State.png: This depicts Sonic running on the Test Stage in Velocity State, with the view zoomed in by a lot.
